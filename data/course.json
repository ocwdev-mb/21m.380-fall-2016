  "course_description": "This course is an introduction to music recording and audio production from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. Learn about the physical nature and human perception of sound, how it is transformed to and from electrical signals by means of microphones and loudspeakers, and how it can be creatively modeled through mixing consoles, signal processors, and digital audio workstations. The course covers making informed choices about microphone selection and positioning, and various editing, mixing, and mastering techniques.\n",
